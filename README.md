A minimalist Downloads management extension for the Gnome Shell.

It allows you to:

- EMPTY the Downloads folder (Empty Button)
- OPEN the Downloads folder (Open Button)
- OPEN items with default app (Click on item)
- TRASH item (X button)
    

It hides completely when the Downloads folder is empty, and listen for changes in the directory.

/home/username/Downloads
