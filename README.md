Gnome Downloads Indicator
===========================

A minimalist Downloads management extension for the Gnome Shell.

It allows you to:

    * EMPTY the downloads folder (Empty Button)
    
    * OPEN the downloads folder (Open Button)
    
    * OPEN items (Click on item)
    
    * DELETE item from downloads (X button)
    

It hides completely when the downloas folder is empty, and listen for changes in directory.

/home/username/Downloads

# Manual Installation
Clone the repository to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ and restart the
shell.
